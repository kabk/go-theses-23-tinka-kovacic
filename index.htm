			<h2 id="intro">The Abstract</h2>

			<p>
				This project derived from my personal fascination with creativity, the imaginary, death, and memory and how they are interconnected. I am interested in the human need to depict, remember and the need to feel remembered. Many attempts have been made to achieve immortality through different methods, time periods and cultures; let it be physical or the immortality of the soul; however, the one I will be researching is creative and biological symbolic immortality perceived through the lens of memory. Within that I am intrigued by the role of death and life in the concept of ever-lasting life. Whether or not, people have been intentionally working towards making themselves immortal and why the need to leave something behind? How does perception of an individual alter the reality of the depiction and is it even able to subsist without an active engagement? Is being forgotten an even bigger fear than dying itself and whom is immortality for? I am interested in the medium of immortality and how most of the things we consider eternal, if not properly preserved, could be easily lost. 			</p>

			<h2 id="chapter-1">Longing</h2>

			<p style="text-align:center; position: relative; font-size: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">
				“I remember staring into her eyes not saying a word as time stood still. I finish my espresso and share a small smile with the world. A smile with a dash of pain and a spring of love. For I know the memories we wrote will never be forgotten. Hidden forever until awoken.” <br><br>
			</p>
			<p>
				It was a rainy November evening in Ghent when I received these words from someone, whom I have been trying to forget for a long time now. These verses burned me like a sting of a wasp that always keeps returning and wounding me in the exact same spot. Despite the pain they carry, I immediately run home and pack them in a little beige box I bought my first pointe shoes in, along with all the other memories I hold dear. Today they might hurt too much, but I cannot risk losing them, they are way too precious. As I lay on the bed that night, crying my eyes out, I start thinking about all the things in that box. I close my eyes and travel back in time to Budapest to the exhibition of Frida Kahlo, where she tells me the story of her tragic life, I cry for her, and for my grandpa, who is still sitting on that sunny terrace of Napotnikova street wearing a white undershirt and classic Wayfarer Ray-Ban sunglasses, sipping on his spritzer. He smiles at me. I inhale and open my eyes. In my hands, I am now holding a little pocketknife he gave me, which folds inside a metal form of a Gondola boat he got in one of his trips to Venice. My eyelids suddenly feel heavy again, when the floor below my feet slowly begin to feel unstable. It is summer 2020. We are in Amsterdam, and I am watching you light up a cigarette. You are sitting silently on the top of the deck looking in the distance as the sun sets. I wonder what you are thinking about right now… Somehow, I am still asleep, but I awake from the unconscious. In front of me, there is complete darkness, but the sound that before was slightly blurred starts refining. It is the sound of the applause. I am standing on a stage with my head lightly tiled before the audience. I have just performed the 3rd Odalisque variation of Le Corsaire. My feet are so used to these steps, they take over and move without my mind’s orders. I relive all the places, the emotions and the people so vividly, as if it had just happened. My tears dry up and I feel untroubled again. 
				<p style="text-align:center; position: relative; font-size: 1.5em; font-style: italic;">
				"As the morning bird wakes up late, the sun is still cuddling behind the blanket of clouds. Rise and shine my little morning doves, there is apple sprits waiting for you." 
				</p>
				<p>
				For ages, humankind believed to be in the center of the universe. And that Earth that they inhabited was the planet that was therefore central as well. When the scientist Nikolaus Copernicus challenged this notion and suggested differently and placed not Earth, but the Sun in the center of our solar system, he was widely criticized, only later to discover that his argument was correct. Despite my total comprehension of our self-importance, and self-worth, the value of other species, and understanding that we need to consider other perspectives than our own, I do feel doubtful sometimes to what extent humankind and our work are significant. <br><br>
				Surely, leaving traces of collective history was essential to understanding our ancestors and the knowledge they have acquired through their experiences and reasoning. Documenting that knowledge and preserving it through the centuries made it possible to rediscover what has been already forgotten. It has helped us to reconstruct some parts of our history. Contemplating where we come from or where are we going, what is the meaning of life and why do we exist, these artifacts from the past have helped us to offer answers to these existential questions. But who decides what is worth protecting and what not? Who is certain these artifacts will bring us to some meaningful conclusion or will instead be completely useless. This little beige box that means the world to me, might mean absolutely nothing to you. Perhaps it will mean something to my descendants, like my grandfather’s pocketknife means so much to me. I know as long as I am breathing, he continues living on in my consciousness and that pocketknife only serves as a portal that takes me back to the terrace of his house. Therefore, in my mind, he is immortal. Conclusively, his immortality is indirectly ensured through one of his belongings, an object, and my memory. <br><br>

				Immortality: the quality of being able to live or last forever or the quality of being very special and famous and therefore likely to be remembered for a long time.<br><br>
				It is the opposing term to mortality. Many aims have been made to achieve immortality through different methods, time periods and cultures. Each religion has its own interpretation of life, death, and what happens after it. Numerous are known for promising an afterlife, like Judaism, Islam and Christianity, which has through the decades successfully profited of people's fear of death and guilt. From the Egyptians saving bodies in the tombs in pursuit of the spiritual afterlife, to the Alchemists desire to obtain the elixir of life to become immortal or Buddhistic belief of reincarnation that also suggest continuity. Within the realm of physical immortality, already briefly touched upon by Alchemists in their health-focused way of living, cryonics  has emerged in the 70s in the faith that one day life extension will become possible. In the century the most plausible achievement of an eternal life is the uploading of consciousness into a cyberspace, also known as digital immortality, which the humanity is closer to every day.<br><br>
				Let it be the physical or the immortality of the soul; however, the one I will be diving into is the symbolic immortality that is ensured through memory. (Or I will focus on symbolic immortality through the lens of memory.) This term was established by Harvard psychiatrist Robert J. Lifton, MD, referring to what comes before us and what remains of us after death, enabling us to participate in an ongoing life without denying the actuality of death. He divided symbolic immortality into five different categories: biological, creative, natural, theological and experimental. This thesis will focus on one aspect, the creative, which captures human creations and lasting influences on others and the biological within it. <br><br>
				A few years ago my grandma started saying she's next in line. What she means by that is that she is queuing for death. Once I asked her to explain this, as hearing such things might sound kind of morbid, she – without any hesitation – told me that she had already done everything in her life that she could have wished for. “I worked,” she said, “I fell in love, I had a family and took care of it, I raised you so that you can take care of yourself and now what am I still here for? What does such an old person have to live for?” That made me question who is life for but foremost who is mortality and the wish of immortality truly for? Nonetheless not wanting to live forever does not rule out the inevitable fear of being forgotten. She as anyone else still wants to be remembered. Therefore, memory is a passage to eternal life without the actual weight or price of living. <br><br>
				So where does this longing for eternal life initially come from, the need to feel remembered? Perhaps it is the fear that the life you lived becomes meaningless once you cease to exist or the notion of not understanding how something that once lived and created can now simply disappear. Maybe it is a reminder to upcoming generations or even other species of our accomplishments and the doom we brought upon ourselves. It could be our sense of self-importance, a deeply egoistical point of view or even a political statement, a reminder of one’s achievements, beliefs and legacy. And frankly, it may be all the above.<br>
